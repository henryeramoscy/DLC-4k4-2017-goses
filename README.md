#Practical work Unique [Search Engine - Vector Model]

Phrasing and Slogans:

The practical work for the integrator will develop a search engine , based on the principles of theoretical classes of matter. The basic requirements for that engine will be:

1.) The engine must be designed to be used on a document database , which will contain only plain text files (.txt extension). The original folder with all documents in the index is diracción:  https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_R7SeoAotsmUUtYendIX04zRjA&usp=sharing . The specified folder contains 500 documents and each is a literary work in English. No links to other documents within each of the text files provided.

2.) you call using the vector model for engine development. The vector model is well known, and our demand is justified in that students master a widespread and basic before launching into more innovative technology.

3.) Students could download documents and index and search locally. Ideally, the time of delivery the engine indexing documents directly from whose url folder above, and proceed to answer queries taking files from the same folder, but since in practice it is asking a prototype, is accept that documents be contained locally.

4.) The only practical work carried out in the course TSB provided for the implementation Vocabulary for a subset of documents of the same document database. Now, DLC , calls for reusen what was done in TSB, which complement and incorporate the design of the prototype complete search engine.

5.) They should take special care in the design and implementation of the posting list of each term, to avoid excessive disk occupation. Lists posteo can come implemented in databases (running for student design thereof), but clarified that in a real situation, and for reasons of performance, the postings lists are often implemented in binary files managed directly by the programmer, not databases.

6.) It is assumed that the system interface should allow an open consultation, and the browser should display a list of the titles of the documents relevant to that query. Each title should come as hyperlink (link) to the actual document, which will open (or downloaded) if the link is activated. However, it is not mandatory to design a web interface for the end user.  

7.) Basic elements of the JEE platform for engine development, so that at the same time apply the concepts learned in the practical and theoretical should be used. students a couple of models containing the basic architecture boot will be provided, so that they can complete it by incorporating therein the indexing module and the search module.

8.) Any added will be welcome, as long as the work is completely finished within a reasonable period of time studied the matter. Students must calculate that the complete development Insuma them no more than a month during the completed work.
